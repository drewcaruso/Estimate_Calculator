# Estimate_Calculator

Utility created for Caruso Bros. Inc for job estimates

Requested by owners Mike and Dom Caruso of Caruso Bros. Inc, this utility was created to provide a fast and easy estimation calculator
based on how Dom and Mike give estimates for asphalt paving jobs. 

The code is provided in both Python and Java. 

According to Dom, instead of a separate labor estimate, sometimes he will increase the price per square feet depending on the diffculty of the job. This would include driveways/jobs that have many corners (which is why the area dimensions are a rough estimate), the depth of the job, location, and any other factors. Cost will also be increased or decreased after job depending on issues that arise. This utility was created to only provide broad generalized estimates as Mike and Dom normally do to save time. 

Because of the general use of this utility, the Java code uses floats and ints, where for higher precision BigDecimal, or at least something more accurate than floats would be used. Similarly with Python, ints were used instead of the decimal module.
